xdxf-dicts
==========

XDXF conversion of open source and freely available dictionaries, especially from Ubuntu packages.

You can get other dictionaries from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdxf/files/dicts-XDXF/
(I wasn't aware of it when I first created this project)

Thank you to @soshial of https://github.com/soshial/xdxf_makedict fame for making this possible :)

Files are `xz -2e` compressed because GitHub won't allow > 100 MB files.
`xz -2e` is chosen because it gives better compression than bzip2, while decompresses much faster
(4-5x) than bzip2, and reasonable decompression memory usage.
